# boulder-coffee-app
A website build with Flask and Bootstrap that lists climbing-and boulderhalls with wifi and good coffee.

## Description
The goal for this project was to create a professional portfolio project after succesfully completed my 100 Days of Python Pro Bootcamp. First, I built the back-end. A REST API. The climber API. For testing my endpoints, I used Postman.

Secondly I developed my front end, a workable website that uses this data, localhosting with wtforms and csv-file. 

... but then I've stretched my coding skills! I used Alchemy and Bootstrap to display the sportcafes. development, create a website that uses this data. For external hosting parts of the code in main.py had to be rewritten. The latest version should display all sportcafes, but it should also allow people to add new cafes or delete cafes.
